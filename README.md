## About :point_down: 

</div align="justified">

Graph plotting is a very common and impotant. I made this software Grapher for get plotted graph as result of user input co-ordinates. First of all we have to enter how many points we want to plot. Then we have to input the x and y co-ordinates accordingly. Then we can see the graph plot, slope and also a place to write the file name to save our graph. We can see the output with accurate graph plot and x and y co-ordinates' name written.
